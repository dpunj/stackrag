Develop a simple Python backend for a RAG pipeline using LLM for a knowledge base consisting of PDF files.

### Key components

1. Data ingestion
2. Query processing
3. Semantic search
4. Post-processing
5. Generation

### Deliverable

- A Github repo with
  - [ ] README.md detailing the system design 
  - [ ] Python implementation of the pipeline using FastAPI
    - [ ] **Ingestion**: One endpoint to send one or more PDF files for ingestion
    - [ ] **Querying** endpoint to query the system with user question

> Make sure to include **specific libraries and software** used and **commit history**

> Must use FastAPI and Mistral AI API
